\arguments{
\item{formula}{If formula = NULL, LCA without regression model is fitted. If
a regression model is to be fitted, specify a formula using R standard syntax,
e.g., Y ~ age + sex + trt. Do not include manifest variables in the regression
model specification. These will be appended internally as latent classes.}

\item{manifest}{character vector containing the names of each manifest variable,
e.g., manifest = c("Z1", "med_3", "X5")}

\item{inits}{list of initial values for WinBUGS. Defaults will be set if nothing
is specified.}

\item{return.bugs}{= FALSE. If TRUE, return the bugs model as a character string.
This can be further edited to suit the researchers needs, e.g., by adding hyper-prior
distributions.}

\item{dir}{Specify full path to the directory where you want
to store the WinBUGS output files and BUGS model file.}

\item{...}{}

\value{
a named list of draws.

\description{
Perform Bayesian LCA
}
\details{
Given a set of categorical predictors, draw posterior distribution of 
probability of class membership for each observation.
