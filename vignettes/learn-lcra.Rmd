## Install

First, install and load the `pairsurv` package from Github using the following 
code:

If you have not installed devtools, run the following:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=F}
install.packages("devtools")
```

If devtools is sucessfully installed, run: 

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
if(!require(pairsurv)) {
  library(devtools)
  install_github('umich-biostatistics/pairsurv') 
}
```

Load the package:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
library(pairsurv)
```

## Results

### pairtest()

#### Example 1: Analysis of package data set `pairdata`.

Enrolled 3711 patients with mild-to-severe nonproliferative or early proliferative 
diabetic retinopathy in both eyes from April 1980 to July 1985.

  * One eye per patient was randomized to early photocoagulation 
  * The other eye deferred photocoagulation until detection of high-risk proliferative retinopathy 
  * Survival endpoint: Time to severe visual loss (deﬁned as visual acuity < 5/200 at two consecutive visits) subject to censoring 
  * Eventually detected a beneﬁt with early photocoagulation 
  * After 9 years of follow-up, only 5.5% of patients had experienced the event (lots of censoring)

Important Feature of ETDRS Data Set (pairdata): Paired Event Times

Paired Design Attractive: 

  * Historically used to minimize variability in treatment comparisons 
  * With positive correlation in pairs that is taken into account in an analysis: 
    + higher power for ﬁxed sample size than independent designs 
    + smaller required sample size for ﬁxed power than independent designs 
    + At the time the ETDRS study was published, the investigators did not have access to these paired tests for censored survival data, but they recognized the statistical issues relating to the correlated structure of the data. Some exploratory analysis on their part suggested “that not taking pairing into account led to conservative tests (ETDRS Research Group, 1991a, p. 749).”

Here is a preview of the data structure:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
head(pairdata)
```

Documentation for pairsurv:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=F}
?pairsurv
```

The function `pairsurv` requires the time-to-event data for each pair (`x1` and `x2`)
and the event indicator for each of the times (`delta1` for `x1`, and `delta2` for `x2`).
The event indicators (`delta1`, `delta2`) equal 1 if the event occurred and 0 if the 
patient was censored.

The call to `pairtest` produces the results for Murray's paired test:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
eyeresults = pairtest(x1 = pairdata$x1, delta1 = pairdata$delta1, 
                      x2 = pairdata$x2, delta2 = pairdata$delta2, n = 3711)
```

Print a summary of the results:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
summary(eyeresults)
```

If you need to access any result not printed by pairtest, use the $ operator to 
search available objects to extract. The test statistic and p-value for each 
test is returned from the call to pairsurv in a list.

Here are the printed and stored results extracted from pairsurv:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
# Upper limit of integration
(integration_upper_limit = eyeresults$upperlim)

# Logrank statistic
(logrank_statistic = eyeresults$lgrk.stat.p)
(logrank_statistic_p = 2*(pnorm(logrank_statistic, lower.tail = T))) # since negative statistic

# Gehan statistic
(gehan_statistic = eyeresults$gehan.stat.p)
(gehan_statistic_p = 2*(pnorm(gehan_statistic, lower.tail = T))) # since negative statistic

# Years of Life statistic
(yls_statistic = eyeresults$yls.stat.p)
(yls_statistic_p = 2*(pnorm(yls_statistic, lower.tail = F))) # since positive statistic

# Pepe Fleming statistic
(pepe_flem_statistic = eyeresults$pf.stat.p)
(pepe_flem_statistic_p = 2*(pnorm(pepe_flem_statistic, lower.tail = F))) # since positive statistic

# Logrank statistic assuming independence
(logrank_assuming_indep = eyeresults$lgrk.nopair.stat.p)
(logrank_assuming_indep_p = 2*(pnorm(logrank_assuming_indep, lower.tail = T)) ) # since negative statistic

# Gehan statistic assuming independence
(gehan_assuming_indep = eyeresults$gehan.nopair.stat.p)
(gehan_assuming_indep_p = 2*(pnorm(gehan_assuming_indep, lower.tail = T))) # since negative statistic

# Years of Life assuming independence
(yls_assuming_indep = eyeresults$yls.nopair.stat.p)
(yls_assuming_indep_p = 2*(pnorm(yls_assuming_indep, lower.tail = F))) # since positive statistic

# Pepe Fleming assuming independence
(pf_assuming_indep = eyeresults$pf.nopair.stat.p)
(pf_assuming_indep_p = 2*(pnorm(pf_assuming_indep, lower.tail = F))) # since positive statistic

# group size adjustment
nstuff = ((3711*3711) / (3711 + 3711))^(.5)

# estimate area between survival curves and 95% conf. int.
(yls.diff = eyeresults$yls.num / nstuff)

(yls.upper = yls.diff + 1.96*sqrt(eyeresults$yls.type.var) / nstuff)
(yls.lower = yls.diff - 1.96*sqrt(eyeresults$yls.type.var) / nstuff)

# 95% CI assuming independence
(yls.upper2 = yls.diff + 1.96*sqrt(eyeresults$yls.nopair.type.var) / nstuff)
(yls.lower2 = yls.diff - 1.96*sqrt(eyeresults$yls.nopair.type.var) / nstuff)
```


##### Other options in summary and plot methods

The result of `summary()` of a pairtest object has a digits option to specify more
or less precision than the default:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
summary(eyeresults, digits = 6)
```

### TM()

Repeated time-to-event data with two treatment groups.

The example data set contains 200 observations of 10 variables, where each row
contains a subject ID, one covariate, censoring indicator, group indicator, 
and Z (a set of times to each follow up).

```{r}
data("TMdata")
```

Preview the data set:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
head(TMdata)
```

Documentation for TM:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=F}
?TM
```

This method requires some pre-processing of the data. Follow our example:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
N = nrow(TMdata) # Number of subjects
X = TMdata$X
delta = TMdata$delta
table(delta)
Z = TMdata[,c('Z1', 'Z2', 'Z3', 'Z4', 'Z5', 'Z6')]
A = max(X) # length of the study
Treatment = as.numeric(TMdata$Group == 1) #1 if Case and 0 if Control
table(Treatment, delta)
```

The call to `TM` produces the results for the Tayob and Murray two-sample recurrent events test.

The two available methods for assessing treatment differences include "average" for 
mean difference test or "area" for area between the RMRL curves. The `method = "average"`
default is assumed if not explicitly specified.

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
srec.average = TM(X = X, delta = delta, Z = Z, Group = Treatment, Tau = A/2, 
                  t = seq(from = 0, to = A-A/2, by = A/4))
```

Print a summary of the results:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
summary(srec.average)
```

Now with `method = "area"`:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
srec.area = TM(X = X, delta = delta, Z = Z, Group = Treatment, Tau = A/2, 
               t = seq(from = 0, to = A-A/2, by = A/4), method = "area")
```

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
summary(srec.area)
```

If the area method is used, a plot option is also available:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
plot(srec.area)
```

##### Other options in summary and plot methods

The result of `summary()` of a TM object has a digits option to specify more
or less precision than the default:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
summary(srec.area, digits = 6)
```

### TM2()

The function `TM2()` allows the user to compute restricted mean survival across multiple 
follow-up intervals.

The reference paper is Tayob, N. and Murray, S., 2016. Nonparametric restricted mean analysis
 across multiple follow-up intervals. Statistics & probability letters, 109, pp.152-158.
 
This method allows for flexibility in choosing variance estimate for the restricted mean survival. The options
are `proposed`, `sandwich`, and `independence`. See the reference paper for details.

The data set contains follow-up times over multiple intervals (X) and the censoring
indicator (delta; 1 if subject died, 0 if censored). The data set is in the "long" format
where multiple events are each recorded as a new row rather than a new column.

The data set contains a total of 100 follow-up times.

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
data("TM2data")
#?TM2data
```

The maximum recorded time in the data set is:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
max(TM2data$X)
```

Similar to the other methods in this package, `TM2` is the work-horse estimation function
and calling `summary()` on the resultant fit object produces a printed summary of 
the output, and calling `plot()` produces a plot of the estimate and 95% bounds.

Documentation for TM2:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=F}
?TM2
```

An example of analysis with `tau = 12` and all three variance estimates:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
output = TM2(X = TM2data$X, delta = TM2data$delta, Tau = 12, 
             t = seq(from = 0, to = 24, by = 6), var_output = "all")
summary(output)
plot(output)
```

An example of analysis with `tau = 12` and proposed variance estimate only (default):

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
output = TM2(X = TM2data$X, delta = TM2data$delta, Tau = 12, 
             t = seq(from = 0, to = 24, by = 6))
summary(output)
plot(output)
```

An example of analysis with `tau = 12` and independent variance estimate only:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
output = TM2(X = TM2data$X, delta = TM2data$delta, Tau = 12, 
             t = seq(from = 0, to = 24, by = 6), var_output = "independence")
summary(output)
plot(output)
```

An example of analysis with `tau = 12` and sandwich variance estimate only:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=T}
output = TM2(X = TM2data$X, delta = TM2data$delta, Tau = 12, 
             t = seq(from = 0, to = 24, by = 6), var_output = "sandwich")

summary(output)
plot(output)
```

##### Other options in summary and plot methods

Use `?` to explore other options to summary and plot:

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=F}
?summary.TM2
```

As you can see from the `Usage` section of the document, the `digits = ` argument 
can optionally be specified if you prefer more or less precision.

```{r, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T, include=T, eval=F}
?plot.TM2
```

Optional arguments for the plot method include `alpha = 0.05, conservative_index = 25, 
k = 500, n.sim = 1000`. 

Here is a summary from the documentation:

 - `alpha` is the significance level for the confidence bands
 - `conservative_index` is the minimum number of events after the start of the last interval
 - `k` is the number of points for integration within follow-up window [0,Tau]
 - `n.sim` is the number of samples simulated to calculate confidence bands

These arguments can be adjusted to suit the user's plotting needs.
