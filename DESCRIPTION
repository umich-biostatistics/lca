Title: Bayesian Joint Latent Class and Regression Models
Type: Package
Description: For fitting Bayesian joint latent class and regression models using
    Gibbs sampling. See the documentation for the model.
    The technical details of the model implemented here are described in Elliott,
    Michael R., Zhao, Zhangchen, Mukherjee, Bhramar, Kanaya, Alka, Needham,
    Belinda L., "Methods to account for uncertainty in latent class assignments when
    using latent classes as predictors in regression models, with application to
    acculturation strategy measures" (2020) In press at Epidemiology
